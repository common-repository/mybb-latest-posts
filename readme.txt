Enables a widget that displays latest threads or posts from a MyBB forum.

== Description ==

This plugin was made by the same author who developed WordBB (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordbb/). I wanted a simpler version of the plugin without the bridging part, this plugin installs a widget that simply displays the latest threads or post from your MyBB forums.

Features:

* No. of threads or posts to display
* option to exclude forums
* options to select latest threads, latest posts or threads with recent activity
* option to show member avatars

*Please note I'm not the developer for this plugin and my knowledge in programming is very limited. You can still contact me or leave a message and I will try to assist as much as possible.*

== Installation ==

1. Upload `mybb-latest.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Find the widget under 'Appearance'->'Widgets'
4. Enter your MyBB database login info (can be found in your forums/inc/config.php)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can't we just use WordBB? =

WordBB causes some conflict with certain plugins and in my case 'Stream Video Player', and the bridging doesn't work to my expectations. This is a much simpler version of WordBB for anyone who just wants to display latest forum posts on their Wordpress site with a widget.

= I have a feature request, can you help? =

Sorry but I'm not the developer for this plugin, there's little I can do to help.

== Screenshots ==
